    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <p>
        A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card,
        or, are different on each card. All of the features must separately satisfy this rule. In other words: shape
        must be either the same in all 3 cards, or different on each if the 3 cards; color must be either the same on
        all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3, etc. See Examples below.
    </p>
